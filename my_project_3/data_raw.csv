An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature

    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not

This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.,"https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the
'frame-ancestors' directive) HTTP header with the page's response.
